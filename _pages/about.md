I am a joint Ph.D student of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), and the School of Computer Science, Univeristy of Technology, Sydney (UTS), superviced by Asist. Prof. [Jin Zhang](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/zhangj4/) and co-superviced by Dr. [Jing Jiang](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Jing.Jiang/about). I received my B.E degree in computer scinece and engineering from the SUSTech.

My current research focuses on volumetric video streaming. My previous research interest includes video analytics in heterogeneous CPU-GPU systems and game theory in crowdsourcing and blockchain.
