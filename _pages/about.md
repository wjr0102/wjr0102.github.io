I am a joint Ph.D of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), and the School of Computer Science, Univeristy of Technology, Sydney (UTS), superviced by A/Prof. [Jin Zhang](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/zhangj4/) and co-superviced by A/Prof. [Jing Jiang](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Jing.Jiang/about). I received my B.E degree in computer scinece and engineering from the SUSTech.

My current research focuses on volumetric video streaming. My previous research interest includes video analytics in heterogeneous CPU-GPU systems and game theory in crowdsourcing and blockchain. I am **open to postdoctoral opportunities related to volumetric video streaming, immersive multimedia, or real-time adaptive systems**.
